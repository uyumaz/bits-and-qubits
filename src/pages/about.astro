      <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Bits & Qubits</strong>, a space where I explore the intersection of
        artificial intelligence, software architecture, engineering leadership, and my endless
        fascination with quantum computing and space exploration.
      </p>

      <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
      <p>This blog covers four main areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AI-Driven Engineering:</strong> Practical insights on integrating AI tools into
          software development workflows, evaluating LLMs, and building AI-powered features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Software Architecture:</strong> Lessons learned from designing scalable systems,
          making technology choices, and navigating the ever-evolving landscape of modern software.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Engineering Leadership:</strong> Thoughts on building teams, fostering engineering
          culture, and the human side of technical organizations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Curiosity Corner:</strong> Deep dives into quantum computing concepts, space
          technology, and other topics that fuel my intellectual curiosity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>About the Author</h2>
      <p>
        I'm <strong>Umut Uyumaz</strong>, a Principal Software Architect at
        <a href="https://www.asml.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASML</a>.
        I'm passionate about software architecture, particularly how systems evolve over time
        and how we can maintain their quality at scale.

      <h2>About the Name</h2>
      <p>
        The name "Bits & Qubits" reflects the duality of my interests. Classical computing deals
        with bits, the fundamental 0s and 1s that power everything from your smartphone to massive
        data centers. Quantum computing introduces qubits, quantum bits that can exist in
        superposition, representing both 0 and 1 simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        The logo <span class="font-mono text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400">⟨B|Q⟩</span> is
        styled after bra-ket notation, the standard mathematical notation used in quantum mechanics.
        It's a small nod to the quantum world that fascinates me.
      </p>
